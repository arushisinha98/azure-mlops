## Notes from Udemy / learn.gov.sg: MLOps Fundamentals: CI/CD/CT Pipelines of ML with Azure Demo

MLOps = Machine Learning + Operations
- set of principles and practices to standardize and streamline the machine learning lifecycle management
- integration b/w development and operational processes
- teams collaborate to build, automate, test, and monitor the machine learning pipelines
- based on DevOps principles of continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), continuous training (CT)

ML >> Dev >> Ops
(data, design, model) >> (plan, create, package, verify) >> (configure, release, triggers, monitor)

traditional approach to an ML project:
- business understanding / requirement gathering
- data acquisition: identify data sources / formats, make source connections, create data lake
- data wrangling / transformations / pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization
- model selection / building / training / testing / validation
- model deployment (e.g. webservices, API)
    - model as a service = model is deployed into a framework to provide REST API endpoint
    - embedded deployment = model is packed into an application / software
- monitoring
- model retraining (on the new data)

subject matter experts
- provide business questions, goals, KPIs to achieve
- continuously evaluate the model performance
data scientists
- algorithm selection
- build, train, validate model
- hyperparameter tuning
data engineers
- data acquisition, data lake creation
- data wrangling, cleaning, tranformstion
- ETL pipelines
ML engineers
- operationalize model
- deployment
